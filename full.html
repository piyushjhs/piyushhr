    <h2>What is a full-stack web developer?</h2>
    <p>Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and backend; so, the full-stack of technology that makes
        up a
        website.

        They are proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and
        hosting
        environments.

        To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in
        a
        variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business logic and user experience, meaning
        they are not only well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.</p>
